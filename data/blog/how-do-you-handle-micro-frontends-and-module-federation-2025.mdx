# How do you handle micro-frontends and module federation? (2025)

Micro-frontends and module federation are modern approaches to scaling frontend development. Interviewers want to know if you can architect and manage distributed frontend systems.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of scalable frontend architectures

## Micro-Frontends

- Split frontend into independent, deployable apps
- Teams can work autonomously

## Module Federation

- Webpack 5 feature for sharing code between apps at runtime
- Enables true micro-frontend architecture

## Example

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'app1',
      remotes: { app2: 'app2@url/remoteEntry.js' },
      exposes: { './Component': './src/Component' },
    }),
  ],
}
```

## Interview Tips

- Mention pros/cons: autonomy, complexity, shared dependencies
- Discuss real-world use cases
