# How do generics work in TypeScript?

Generics are a powerful feature in TypeScript that allow you to write reusable and type-safe code. Interviewers often ask about generics to test your understanding of advanced TypeScript features.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of advanced TypeScript
- To see if you can write reusable, type-safe code

## What are Generics?

Generics allow you to define functions, classes, and types that work with any data type, while maintaining type safety.

## Example

```ts
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg
}
const num = identity<number>(42)
const str = identity<string>('hello')
```

## Interview Tips

- Explain the syntax: `&lt;T&gt;`
- Mention use cases: functions, classes, interfaces
- Be ready to write a generic function

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- Generics allow ...
- For example, ...
- I use generics when ...

## Sample Answer

> Generics in TypeScript let you write functions and types that work with any data type while preserving type safety. For example, a generic identity function can accept and return any type. I use generics to create reusable and flexible code.
