# How do you write and use custom React hooks? Best practices?

Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React for reusing logic. Interviewers ask about them to see if you can write clean, maintainable, and reusable code.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your understanding of hooks and code reuse
- To see if you follow best practices

## How to Write a Custom Hook

- Start with `use` prefix (e.g., useFetch)
- Use built-in hooks inside (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Return state and functions as needed

## Example

```js
function useCounter(initial = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initial)
  const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1)
  return { count, increment }
}

// Usage
const { count, increment } = useCounter()
```

## Best Practices

- Keep hooks focused and reusable
- Avoid side effects outside useEffect
- Document hook usage and return values

## Interview Tips

- Be ready to write a simple custom hook
- Explain why custom hooks improve code quality
- Mention testing hooks

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- A custom hook is ...
- I use custom hooks to ...
- For example, ...

## Sample Answer

> A custom hook is a function that uses React hooks to encapsulate reusable logic. I use custom hooks to share stateful logic across components, making my code cleaner and easier to maintain. For example, I often create hooks for data fetching or form handling.
