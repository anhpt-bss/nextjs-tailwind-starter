# Interface vs Type alias in TypeScript?

Understanding the differences between interface and type alias is important for writing clean, maintainable TypeScript code. This is a common interview question for frontend and TypeScript roles.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of TypeScript's type system
- To see if you know when to use interface vs type

## Interface

- Used to define the shape of objects
- Supports declaration merging and extension

## Type Alias

- Can represent any type (primitive, union, intersection, etc.)
- Cannot be merged, but can use intersections

## Example

```ts
interface User {
  name: string
  age: number
}
type Point = { x: number; y: number }
type ID = string | number
```

## Interview Tips

- Mention declaration merging for interfaces
- Explain when to use each
- Be ready to give examples

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- An interface is ...
- A type alias is ...
- I use interface when ...
- I use type when ...

## Sample Answer

> An interface in TypeScript is used to define the shape of objects and supports extension and merging. A type alias can represent any type, including unions and intersections, but cannot be merged. I use interfaces for object shapes and types for more complex or union types.
