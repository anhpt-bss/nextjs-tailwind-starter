# Context API vs Redux: differences and use cases?

State management is a key topic in React interviews. Interviewers want to know if you understand the trade-offs between Context API and Redux.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of state management
- To see if you can choose the right tool for the job

## Context API

- Built-in React feature for passing data through the component tree
- Best for simple or medium-sized state

## Redux

- External library for managing global state
- Best for complex, large-scale apps with advanced needs (middleware, devtools)

## Example

```js
// Context API
const MyContext = React.createContext();
<MyContext.Provider value={...}>
  <Child />
</MyContext.Provider>

// Redux
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

## Interview Tips

- Compare performance, scalability, and boilerplate
- Mention when to use each
- Be ready to give examples

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- Context API is ...
- Redux is ...
- I use Context API when ...
- I use Redux when ...

## Sample Answer

> Context API is great for simple or medium-sized state sharing, while Redux is better for complex, large-scale applications. I use Context for theme or auth state, and Redux for apps with lots of shared or deeply nested state.
