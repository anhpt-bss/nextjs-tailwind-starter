# Compare Promise, async/await, and callback patterns. When to use each?

Handling asynchronous operations is a key skill in JavaScript. Interviewers often ask about the differences between callbacks, Promises, and async/await to assess your understanding of async code and best practices.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of async programming patterns
- To see if you know when to use each approach

## Callback Pattern

- Functions passed as arguments to handle async results
- Can lead to "callback hell" if nested

## Promise Pattern

- Introduced in ES6 to handle async operations more cleanly
- Supports chaining with `.then()` and `.catch()`

## async/await Pattern

- Syntactic sugar over Promises (ES2017+)
- Makes async code look synchronous

## Example

```js
// Callback
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => { ... });

// Promise
fetch('url').then(res => res.json()).then(data => ...);

// async/await
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('url');
  const data = await res.json();
}
```

## When to Use Each

- Use callbacks for simple, single async tasks
- Use Promises for chaining and better error handling
- Use async/await for readable, sequential async code

## Interview Tips

- Mention error handling differences
- Discuss readability and maintainability
- Be ready to write examples of each

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- Callbacks are ...
- Promises provide ...
- async/await makes ...
- I prefer to use ... when ...

## Sample Answer

> Callbacks are the original way to handle async operations in JavaScript, but can become hard to manage. Promises provide a cleaner way to chain async tasks and handle errors. async/await makes async code easier to read and write. I use async/await for most modern code, but understand when callbacks or Promises are more appropriate.
