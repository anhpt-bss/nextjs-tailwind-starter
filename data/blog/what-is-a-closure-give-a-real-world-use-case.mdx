# What is a closure? Give a real-world use case.

Closures are a core concept in JavaScript and are frequently asked about in interviews. They allow functions to access variables from an outer scope even after that scope has finished executing.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your understanding of JavaScript's function scope and lexical environment
- To see if you can apply closures to solve real-world problems

## What is a Closure?

A closure is a function that remembers and can access variables from outside its own scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

## Real-World Use Case

A common use case for closures is data privacy, such as creating private variables in JavaScript modules or factories.

```js
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0
  return function () {
    count++
    return count
  }
}
const counter = makeCounter()
console.log(counter()) // 1
console.log(counter()) // 2
```

## Interview Tips

- Explain that closures "close over" their environment
- Mention use cases: data privacy, event handlers, callbacks, etc.
- Be ready to write a simple closure example
