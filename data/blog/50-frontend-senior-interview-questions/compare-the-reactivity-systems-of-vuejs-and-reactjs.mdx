# Compare the reactivity systems of VueJS and ReactJS.

Reactivity is at the core of both VueJS and ReactJS, but each framework implements it differently. Interviewers want to know if you understand these differences and their implications.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your understanding of state management and reactivity
- To see if you can choose the right tool for a project

## VueJS Reactivity

- Uses a dependency-tracking system (Proxy in Vue 3, Object.defineProperty in Vue 2)
- Automatically tracks dependencies and updates the DOM when data changes
- Supports reactive primitives (ref, reactive)

## ReactJS Reactivity

- Uses a virtual DOM and explicit state updates (setState/useState)
- Re-renders components when state or props change
- No automatic dependency tracking; relies on hooks and component structure

## Example

```js
// Vue 3
const count = ref(0);
watch(count, (newVal) => { ... });

// React
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
useEffect(() => { ... }, [count]);
```

## Interview Tips

- Mention dependency tracking vs explicit updates
- Discuss performance and developer experience
- Be ready to give code examples

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- VueJS uses ...
- ReactJS relies on ...
- For example, ...

## Sample Answer

> VueJS uses a dependency-tracking system for reactivity, automatically updating the DOM when data changes. ReactJS relies on explicit state updates and re-renders components when state or props change. Both approaches have their strengths, but Vue's system can feel more automatic, while React gives you more control.
