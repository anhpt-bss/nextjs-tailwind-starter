# How do you handle error boundaries and fallback UI in React?

Error boundaries are essential for robust React apps. Interviewers want to know if you can handle errors gracefully and provide a good user experience.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of error handling in React
- To see if you can build resilient UIs

## Error Boundaries

- Special components that catch JS errors in child components
- Implemented with class components (componentDidCatch, getDerivedStateFromError)

## Fallback UI

- UI shown when an error is caught
- Can be a message, retry button, etc.

## Example

```js
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false }
  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true }
  }
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    /* log error */
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) return <div>Something went wrong.</div>
    return this.props.children
  }
}
```

## Interview Tips

- Mention error boundaries are class-only (as of React 18)
- Discuss fallback UI and user experience
- Be ready to give examples

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- Error boundaries are ...
- Fallback UI is ...
