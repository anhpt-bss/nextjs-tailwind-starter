# Explain Angular lifecycle hooks and dependency injection.

Lifecycle hooks and dependency injection are core concepts in Angular. Interviewers want to know if you can use them to build robust, maintainable apps.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

## Lifecycle Hooks

- ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, ngOnDestroy, ngAfterViewInit, etc.
- Allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life

## Dependency Injection (DI)

- Angular's built-in system for providing services to components
- Promotes modularity and testability

## Example

```ts
@Component({ ... })
export class MyComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) {}
  ngOnInit() { /* ... */ }
  ngOnDestroy() { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Interview Tips

- List common hooks and their use cases
- Explain DI benefits
- Be ready to give code examples

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- ngOnInit is used for ...
- Dependency injection allows ...
- For example, ...

## Sample Answer

> Angular lifecycle hooks like ngOnInit and ngOnDestroy let me run code at specific points in a component's life. Dependency injection allows me to provide services to components, making my code more modular and testable.
