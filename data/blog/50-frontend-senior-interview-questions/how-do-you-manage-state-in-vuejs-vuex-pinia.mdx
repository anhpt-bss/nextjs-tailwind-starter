# How do you manage state in VueJS (Vuex, Pinia)?

State management is crucial for large VueJS apps. Interviewers want to know if you can use Vuex or Pinia effectively.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of state management patterns
- To see if you can choose the right tool for the job

## Vuex

- Official state management library for Vue 2/3
- Centralized store, mutations, actions, getters

## Pinia

- Newer, recommended for Vue 3
- Simpler API, better TypeScript support
- Modular stores

## Example

```js
// Vuex
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: { count: 0 },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++
    },
  },
})

// Pinia
import { defineStore } from 'pinia'
const useCounter = defineStore('counter', {
  state: () => ({ count: 0 }),
  actions: {
    increment() {
      this.count++
    },
  },
})
```

## Interview Tips

- Compare Vuex and Pinia
- Mention migration from Vuex to Pinia
- Be ready to give code examples

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- Vuex is ...
- Pinia is ...
