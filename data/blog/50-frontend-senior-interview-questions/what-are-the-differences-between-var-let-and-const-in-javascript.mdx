# What are the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?

Understanding the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` is fundamental for any JavaScript developer, especially in modern ES6+ codebases. This is a common interview question to assess your grasp of variable declarations, scope, and best practices.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals
- To see if you know modern ES6+ features
- To assess your awareness of best practices and potential pitfalls

## Key Differences Table

| Feature        | var                            | let          | const        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Scope          | Function-scoped                | Block-scoped | Block-scoped |
| Hoisting       | Yes (initialized as undefined) | Yes (TDZ\*)  | Yes (TDZ\*)  |
| Redeclaration  | Allowed                        | Not allowed  | Not allowed  |
| Reassignment   | Allowed                        | Allowed      | Not allowed  |
| Initialization | Optional                       | Optional     | Required     |

\*TDZ: Temporal Dead Zone (cannot access before declaration)

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Scope

- **var** is function-scoped. It is visible throughout the function in which it is declared.
- **let** and **const** are block-scoped. They are only visible within the nearest enclosing block (e.g., `{ ... }`).

### 2. Hoisting

- All three are hoisted, but:
  - `var` is initialized as `undefined`.
  - `let` and `const` are not initialized, leading to a ReferenceError if accessed before declaration (TDZ).

### 3. Redeclaration & Reassignment

- `var` can be redeclared and reassigned.
- `let` can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope.
- `const` cannot be redeclared or reassigned (but objects/arrays declared with `const` can have their contents mutated).

### 4. Initialization

- `var` and `let` can be declared without an initial value.
- `const` must be initialized at the time of declaration.

## Code Examples

```js
// var example
function testVar() {
  var x = 1
  if (true) {
    var x = 2 // same variable!
    console.log(x) // 2
  }
  console.log(x) // 2
}

// let example
function testLet() {
  let y = 1
  if (true) {
    let y = 2 // different variable (block scope)
    console.log(y) // 2
  }
  console.log(y) // 1
}

// const example
const z = 10
// z = 20; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
arr.push(4) // Allowed: mutating array contents
```

## Interview Tips

- Always prefer `let` and `const` in modern JavaScript. Use `const` by default, and `let` only if you need to reassign.
- Avoid `var` unless you have a specific reason (e.g., legacy code).
- Be ready to explain hoisting and the temporal dead zone.
- Mention that `const` only prevents reassignment of the variable binding, not mutation of objects/arrays.

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- The main difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` is their scope and how they are hoisted.
- `var` is function-scoped, while `let` and `const` are block-scoped.
- `let` allows reassignment, but `const` does not.
- All three are hoisted, but only `var` is initialized as `undefined`.
- In modern JavaScript, it is best practice to use `const` by default and `let` when you need to reassign.
- For example, ...

## Sample Answer

> The main differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` are their scope, hoisting behavior, and mutability. `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared or reassigned, but is generally avoided in modern code due to potential bugs. `let` and `const` are block-scoped; `let` can be reassigned, while `const` cannot. All three are hoisted, but only `var` is initialized as `undefined`. I always use `const` by default and `let` when I need to reassign a variable.
