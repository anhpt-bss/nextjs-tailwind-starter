# Explain SSR, SSG, ISR in NextJS. When to use each?

NextJS supports multiple rendering strategies: SSR, SSG, and ISR. Interviewers want to know if you can choose the right approach for different scenarios.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of modern rendering strategies
- To see if you can optimize performance and SEO

## SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

- Generates HTML on each request
- Good for dynamic, frequently updated content

## SSG (Static Site Generation)

- Generates HTML at build time
- Best for static, rarely changing content

## ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

- Updates static pages after deployment
- Combines benefits of SSR and SSG

## Example

```js
// SSR: getServerSideProps
// SSG: getStaticProps
// ISR: getStaticProps + revalidate
```

## When to Use

- SSR: user-specific or frequently changing data
- SSG: marketing pages, blogs
- ISR: e-commerce, content sites needing updates

## Interview Tips

- Compare pros and cons
- Mention SEO and performance
- Be ready to give examples

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- SSR is used for ...
- SSG is best for ...
- ISR combines ...

## Sample Answer

> SSR generates pages on each request, SSG builds them at compile time, and ISR allows static pages to update after deployment. I use SSR for dynamic content, SSG for static pages, and ISR for sites that need both performance and up-to-date content.
