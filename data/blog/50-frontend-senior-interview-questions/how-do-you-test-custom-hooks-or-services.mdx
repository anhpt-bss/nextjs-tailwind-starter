# How do you test custom hooks or services?

Testing custom hooks and services ensures reusable logic works as expected. Interviewers want to know if you can write maintainable, reliable tests for these abstractions.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of advanced testing
- To see if you can test reusable logic

## React Custom Hooks

- Use @testing-library/react-hooks or render hooks in a test component
- Mock dependencies as needed

## Angular Services

- Use TestBed to inject and test services
- Mock HTTP and other dependencies

## Example

```js
// React
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react-hooks';
const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter());
act(() => result.current.increment());
expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);

// Angular
const service = TestBed.inject(MyService);
expect(service.method()).toEqual(...);
```

## Interview Tips

- Mention mocking dependencies
- Discuss isolation and coverage

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- To test custom hooks, I ...
- For services, I ...
- For example, ...

## Sample Answer

> To test custom hooks in React, I use @testing-library/react-hooks or render them in a test component, mocking dependencies as needed. For Angular services, I use TestBed to inject and test the service in isolation.
