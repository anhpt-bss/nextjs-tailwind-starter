# How do you mock APIs in frontend tests?

Mocking APIs is essential for reliable and fast tests. Interviewers want to know if you can isolate your tests from real backend dependencies.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of test isolation
- To see if you can use mocking tools effectively

## Mocking Strategies

- Mock fetch/axios with libraries (jest-fetch-mock, msw, nock)
- Use service worker mocks (msw)
- Stub HTTP requests in Angular (HttpTestingController)

## Example

```js
// Jest fetch mock
import fetchMock from 'jest-fetch-mock';
fetchMock.mockResponseOnce(JSON.stringify({ data: 123 }));

// msw
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node';
const server = setupServer(...);

// Angular
const httpMock = TestBed.inject(HttpTestingController);
```
