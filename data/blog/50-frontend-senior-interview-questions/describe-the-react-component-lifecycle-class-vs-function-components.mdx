# Describe the React component lifecycle (class vs function components)

Understanding the React component lifecycle is essential for building robust applications. Interviewers often ask about lifecycle methods and hooks to assess your knowledge of React internals.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your understanding of React's rendering and update process
- To see if you know the differences between class and function components

## Class Component Lifecycle

- **Mounting:** constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount
- **Updating:** static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate
- **Unmounting:** componentWillUnmount

## Function Component Lifecycle (with Hooks)

- useEffect replaces most lifecycle methods
- useLayoutEffect, useMemo, useCallback for advanced cases

## Example

```js
// Class component
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    /* ... */
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    /* ... */
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    /* ... */
  }
  render() {
    return <div />
  }
}

// Function component
function MyComponent() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    /* ... */
  }, []) // mount
  return <div />
}
```

## Interview Tips

- Compare lifecycle methods to hooks
- Mention cleanup in useEffect
- Be ready to draw or describe the lifecycle flow

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- In class components, the lifecycle includes ...
- In function components, hooks like useEffect ...
- For example, ...

## Sample Answer

> In class components, the lifecycle includes mounting, updating, and unmounting phases, with methods like componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount. In function components, hooks like useEffect handle side effects and lifecycle events. I prefer function components for their simplicity and flexibility.
