# How do useMemo and useCallback work? When should you use them?

useMemo and useCallback are React hooks for optimizing performance. Interviewers ask about them to see if you can prevent unnecessary renders and understand React's rendering behavior.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of React performance optimization
- To see if you know when to use memoization

## useMemo

- Memoizes the result of a computation
- Only recalculates when dependencies change

## useCallback

- Memoizes a function reference
- Useful for passing stable callbacks to child components

## Example

```js
const memoizedValue = React.useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b])
const memoizedCallback = React.useCallback(() => doSomething(a), [a])
```

## When to Use

- useMemo: expensive calculations, derived data
- useCallback: stable function props for children

## Interview Tips

- Explain dependency arrays
- Mention premature optimization
- Be ready to give examples

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- useMemo is used for ...
- useCallback is useful when ...
- For example, ...

## Sample Answer

> useMemo is used to memoize expensive calculations so they only run when dependencies change. useCallback memoizes function references to prevent unnecessary re-renders. I use them when optimizing performance in components with heavy computations or many children.
