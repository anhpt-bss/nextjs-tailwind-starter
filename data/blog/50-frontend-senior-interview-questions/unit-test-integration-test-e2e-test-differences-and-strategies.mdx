# Unit test, integration test, e2e test: differences and strategies?

Testing is essential for reliable software. Interviewers want to know if you understand the different types of tests and how to use them effectively.

## Why Interviewers Ask This Question

- To check your knowledge of testing strategies
- To see if you can design a robust test suite

## Unit Test

- Tests individual functions/components in isolation
- Fast, easy to write and maintain

## Integration Test

- Tests how multiple units work together
- Catches issues with interactions between modules

## End-to-End (e2e) Test

- Simulates real user scenarios in the full app
- Slower, but ensures everything works together

## Example

- Unit: test a function or component
- Integration: test a form with validation and API call
- e2e: test user login flow in browser

## Interview Tips

- Mention test pyramid (more unit, fewer e2e)
- Discuss tools (Jest, Testing Library, Cypress, Playwright)
- Give real-world examples

## Useful English Phrases & Sentence Starters

- Unit tests are ...
- Integration tests check ...
- e2e tests simulate ...
- For example, ...

## Sample Answer

> Unit tests check individual functions or components, integration tests check how modules work together, and e2e tests simulate real user flows. I use a mix of all three, focusing on unit tests for speed and reliability, and e2e for critical user journeys.
